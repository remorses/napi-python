# napi-python

Load Node-API (.node) native addons in Python.

## Goal

Run native addons built with napi-rs, node-addon-api, or raw N-API directly in Python without Node.js.

## How it works

1. A C shim library exports all NAPI symbols
2. Python implements the NAPI functions via ctypes
3. When a .node file loads, it resolves symbols from our shim
4. Native callbacks get wrapped as Python callables

## Usage

```python
from napi_python import load_addon

addon = load_addon("path/to/addon.node")
result = addon.add(1, 2)
```

## Status

Early development. Basic functions work, classes and async are WIP.
